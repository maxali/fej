# fej v2 Planning Summary

## Executive Summary

I've completed a comprehensive review of the **fej** project and created detailed planning documents for version 2.0. This document provides a high-level summary of findings and recommendations.

---

## 🔍 What is fej?

**fej** is a lightweight fetch API wrapper that provides middleware support for manipulating HTTP requests. It enables developers to add synchronous and asynchronous middleware functions to modify requests before execution, similar to Express.js middleware but for the Fetch API.

**Current Version:** 1.0.5  
**Status:** Functional but needs significant improvements  
**Primary Language:** TypeScript  
**Dependencies:** Zero (runtime)

## 📊 Project Assessment

### Overall Score: 6/10

| Category           | Score   | Notes                             |
| ------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Concept**        | 9/10 ⭐ | Excellent idea, fills a real need |
| **Implementation** | 5/10 ⚠️ | Working but has critical bugs     |
| **Testing**        | 2/10 ⚠️ | Minimal coverage, only 1 test     |
| **Documentation**  | 5/10 ⚠️ | Basic but incomplete              |
| **Maintenance**    | 4/10 ⚠️ | Outdated tooling, inactive        |

---

## ✅ Strengths

1. **Clean API Design** - Simple, intuitive middleware pattern
2. **Zero Dependencies** - No runtime dependencies, minimal footprint
3. **TypeScript Support** - Full type definitions included
4. **Focused Purpose** - Does one thing well (middleware for fetch)
5. **Small Bundle Size** - Minimal impact on applications

---

## ❌ Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Async Middleware Execution Bug** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Location:** `src/index.ts:63-64`

```typescript
// Current (WRONG)
const mdwResults = await Promise.all(this.asyncMiddleWares);

// The bug: This awaits the array itself, not the execution results
```

### 2. **Incorrect Method Signature** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Location:** `src/index.ts:27`

```typescript
// Current (WRONG)
public addMiddleware = async (fn: IFejMiddleware) => {

// Problem: Method declared async but doesn't need to be
// and doesn't return Promise
```

### 3. **Outdated Dependencies** 🟡 HIGH

- TypeScript 3.5.2 (2019) → Should be 5.x
- TSLint (deprecated) → Should be ESLint
- Mocha 6.x → Should be Vitest or latest Mocha
- Build errors with modern type definitions

### 4. **Minimal Test Coverage** 🟡 HIGH

- Only 1 basic test exists
- No middleware functionality tests
- No error handling tests
- No integration tests
- Estimated coverage: <10%

### 5. **Type Safety Issues** 🟡 MEDIUM

- Uses `any` type in merge functions
- No runtime validation
- Potential type inference issues

## 🎯 Key Improvements in v2

### API Evolution

#### v1 (Current)

```typescript
import Fej from 'fej';

Fej.setInit({ headers: {...} });
Fej.addMiddleware(fn);
Fej.addAsyncMiddleware(asyncFn);

const response = await fej('/api/users');
```

#### v2 (Proposed)

```typescript
import { createFej } from 'fej';

const api = createFej({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
  timeout: 5000,
  retry: { attempts: 3 },
});

// Named middleware
api.use('auth', async (req, next) => {
  const token = await getToken();
  req.headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);
  await next();
  return req;
});

// Convenience methods
const users = await api.get('/users');
const user = await api.post('/users', { name: 'John' });

// Interceptors
api.intercept.response((res) => {
  if (!res.ok) throw new ApiError(res);
  return res;
});
```

### New Features

- ✅ Named middleware with management
- ✅ Middleware removal and priority
- ✅ Request/response interceptors
- ✅ Error middleware
- ✅ Retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ Timeout handling
- ✅ Request cancellation (AbortController)
- ✅ Debug mode
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Plugin system
