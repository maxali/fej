## Risks & Issues

### Potential Issues

1. **Deprecation Warning Fatigue**
   - **Risk:** Users may ignore warnings if they appear too frequently
   - **Mitigation:** ‚úÖ Warnings show once per session
   - **Status:** Addressed

2. **Migration Guide Outdated**
   - **Risk:** API may change during alpha/beta, making guide outdated
   - **Mitigation:** ‚è≥ Need to review and update during each release
   - **Status:** Action needed during alpha

3. **Low Survey Response Rate**
   - **Risk:** May not get 5-10 responses needed
   - **Mitigation:** ‚è≥ Need active outreach to GitHub stars and users
   - **Status:** Action needed during distribution

4. **Bundle Size Increase**
   - **Risk:** 1-2KB increase may concern size-sensitive users
   - **Mitigation:** ‚úÖ Documented in announcement, temporary increase
   - **Status:** Acceptable trade-off

   - `npm test`
   - Manual testing of warnings

2. **Set up GitHub Discussions** (30 min)
   - Enable feature
   - Create categories
   - Post announcement and alpha sign-up

3. **Publish v1.9 to npm** (30 min)
   - Git commit and tag
   - `npm publish`
   - Verify on npm registry

4. **Announce v2** (1 hour)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation takes time but is essential**
   - 3 hours spent on docs was worthwhile
   - Users need clear guidance for breaking changes

2. **Templates save time later**
   - GitHub Discussion templates will speed up community engagement
   - Survey template is reusable for future feedback

3. **Deprecation warnings are user-friendly**
   - Better than suddenly breaking code
   - Provides clear migration path

4. **Scope management is critical**
   - Focused on Phase 0.2 deliverables only
   - Avoided scope creep into Phase 1 work

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 0.2 (v1.9 Deprecation Release) is substantially complete.**

**Core deliverables (100%):**

- ‚úÖ Deprecation warnings in code
- ‚úÖ Migration guide
- ‚úÖ Announcement content
- ‚úÖ User survey
- ‚úÖ Discussion templates
- ‚úÖ Package updates
