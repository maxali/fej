## Risks & Mitigations

### Recruitment Risks

**Risk**: Not enough alpha testers apply
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Minimum viable = 5 testers, extend recruitment 1 week if needed
- **Fallback**: Proceed with smaller group

**Risk**: Wrong mix of testers (all beginners or all advanced)
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Diversity scorecard, active selection for balance
- **Fallback**: Accept that first alpha may have gaps, address in beta

### Testing Risks

**Risk**: Testers drop out mid-alpha
- **Likelihood**: Medium (expected 20-30% attrition)
- **Mitigation**: Select 15-20 to account for dropouts
- **Fallback**: Continue with remaining testers

**Risk**: Critical bugs found, need to pause alpha
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Thorough internal testing done, 319 tests passing
- **Fallback**: Release patches quickly, extend alpha if needed

### Feedback Risks

**Risk**: Low engagement, minimal feedback
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Structured weekly check-ins, clear testing checklist
- **Fallback**: Direct outreach to testers, offer recognition/incentives

**Risk**: Overwhelming feedback, can't keep up
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Response SLAs, prioritization (P0-P3), focus on critical
- **Fallback**: Extend alpha period, defer P3 issues to beta

## Lessons Learned (Preparation Phase)

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Created 2,000+ lines of alpha-specific docs in 1 day
   - Clear, actionable guidance for all stakeholders
   - Templates for consistency

2. **Structured Process**
   - Selection criteria clear and fair
   - Testing plan well-organized (4-week structure)
   - Feedback channels well-defined

3. **Technical Readiness**
   - Alpha already published on npm
   - All tests passing
   - Quality gates validated

### What Could Be Improved 🟡

1. **Earlier Preparation**
   - Could have prepared alpha docs during Phase 3
   - Would reduce time pressure before launch

2. **Automated Tools**
   - Codemod tool not ready yet
   - Manual migration may be harder for testers
   - Should prioritize codemod for beta

3. **Marketing**
   - No social media presence prepared
   - Limited outreach channels
   - Could expand recruitment reach

### Apply to Future Phases 📋

1. **Beta Preparation**
   - Start beta docs earlier (during alpha)
   - Prepare marketing materials in advance
   - Have codemod ready before beta

2. **RC Preparation**
   - Migration guide must be 100% complete
   - Codemod tested on real projects
   - Performance benchmarks finalized

## Time Investment

**Estimated**: 8 hours (preparation only)
**Actual**: ~6 hours (1 day)
**Variance**: -25% (under estimate)

**Breakdown:**
- Documentation creation: 4 hours
- Infrastructure setup: 1 hour
- Process design: 1 hour

**Note**: Alpha execution (4 weeks) not included in this summary.
