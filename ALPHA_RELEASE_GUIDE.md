## FAQ for Maintainers

### Q: What if we don't get enough alpha testers?
**A:** Minimum viable: 5 testers. If <10, extend recruitment by 1 week or proceed with smaller group.

### Q: What if a tester stops responding?
**A:** Ping once, if no response in 3 days, accept it and continue. Don't wait.

### Q: Should we accept more than 20 testers?
**A:** Yes, if applications are high quality. Cap at 30 to maintain manageable communication.

### Q: What if alpha takes longer than 4 weeks?
**A:** Extend by max 2 weeks. Communicate new timeline. If >6 weeks needed, re-evaluate scope.

### Q: When to release alpha patches?
**A:** For any P0/P1 bug fix. For P2/P3, batch into weekly patches if multiple fixes available.
