## Critical Bugs Fixed (P0/P1)

### Bug #1: Middleware Execution Order Issue (P0) ‚úÖ FIXED
**Reporter**: @tester-advanced-1 (Week 2)
**Description**: When multiple middleware functions modify the same config property, execution order wasn't deterministic in edge cases.
**Impact**: High - Could cause unexpected behavior in production
**Root Cause**: Middleware priority sorting had a stability issue
**Fix**: Implemented stable sort with explicit priority handling
**Test Added**: Yes - `test/unit/middleware-management.test.ts:325`
**Fixed In**: v2.0.0-alpha.1 (released Week 2, Day 3)

### Bug #2: AbortController Signal Not Propagating (P1) ‚úÖ FIXED
**Reporter**: @tester-intermediate-3 (Week 2)
**Description**: When cancelling a request with `.cancel()`, the abort signal wasn't always propagating to fetch() in browser environments
**Impact**: Medium-High - Request cancellation failures
**Root Cause**: Signal assignment timing in browser vs Node.js
**Fix**: Unified signal handling across environments
**Test Added**: Yes - `test/browser/browser-apis.test.ts:89`
**Fixed In**: v2.0.0-alpha.2 (released Week 2, Day 5)

### Bug #3: Type Inference Failure for Error Middleware (P1) ‚úÖ FIXED
**Reporter**: @tester-typescript-2 (Week 3)
**Description**: TypeScript wasn't correctly inferring error types in error middleware, requiring manual casting
**Impact**: Medium - Poor DX for TypeScript users
**Root Cause**: Generic constraint too loose in middleware type definition
**Fix**: Tightened type constraints, added conditional types
**Test Added**: Yes - `test/types.test.ts:156`
**Fixed In**: v2.0.0-alpha.3 (released Week 3, Day 2)

---

## API Feedback & Changes

### Implemented API Improvements (8)

#### 1. ‚úÖ Add `.removeAll()` Method
**Feedback**: Multiple testers requested a way to remove all middleware at once
**Change**: Added `api.removeAll()` method
**Rationale**: Common use case in testing and reinitialization scenarios
**Breaking**: No
**Implemented**: v2.0.0-alpha.4

#### 2. ‚úÖ Expose Middleware Count via `.size` Property
**Feedback**: Testers wanted to inspect middleware count without accessing internals
**Change**: Added read-only `api.size` property
**Rationale**: Useful for debugging and testing
**Breaking**: No
**Implemented**: v2.0.0-alpha.4

#### 3. ‚úÖ Add `onRetry` Callback to Retry Options
**Feedback**: Need visibility into retry attempts for logging/monitoring
**Change**: Added optional `onRetry(attempt, error, config)` callback
**Rationale**: Common requirement for production monitoring
**Breaking**: No
**Implemented**: v2.0.0-alpha.5

#### 4. ‚úÖ Support Async Error Handlers
**Feedback**: Error handlers should support async operations (logging to external services)
**Change**: Allow async functions in error middleware
**Rationale**: Real-world error handlers often need async operations
**Breaking**: No (backward compatible)
**Implemented**: v2.0.0-alpha.5

#### 5. ‚úÖ Add `.clone()` Method for Config Deep Copy
**Feedback**: Need a safe way to clone config objects in middleware
**Change**: Documented and exposed deep clone utility as `.clone()`
**Rationale**: Useful for middleware that need to modify config without side effects
**Breaking**: No
**Implemented**: v2.0.0-alpha.6

#### 6. ‚úÖ Improve Error Messages with Middleware Context
**Feedback**: Errors should indicate which middleware caused the problem
**Change**: Add middleware name to error stack when available
**Rationale**: Better debugging experience
**Breaking**: No (enhancement)
**Implemented**: v2.0.0-alpha.6

#### 7. ‚úÖ Add `.has(name)` Method to Check Middleware Existence
**Feedback**: Need to check if named middleware exists before removing
**Change**: Added `api.has('name')` method
**Rationale**: Prevents errors when removing non-existent middleware
**Breaking**: No
**Implemented**: v2.0.0-alpha.7

#### 8. ‚úÖ Add `signal` Option to Request Config
**Feedback**: Should support passing custom AbortSignal
**Change**: Allow `signal: AbortSignal` in request config
**Rationale**: Integration with external cancellation logic
**Breaking**: No (enhancement)
**Implemented**: v2.0.0-alpha.7

### Deferred API Suggestions (5)

These suggestions are deferred to post-v2.0 (future versions):

#### 1. üîÑ Middleware Groups/Namespaces
**Feedback**: Organize middleware into groups for easier management
**Reason for Deferral**: Adds complexity, can be built as utility pattern
**Future**: Consider for v2.1 if demand is high

#### 2. üîÑ Built-in Retry Strategies (Exponential, Jitter, etc.)
**Feedback**: Provide more sophisticated retry strategies out-of-the-box
**Reason for Deferral**: Can be implemented as external middleware
**Future**: Consider as official middleware package (fej-retry-strategies)

#### 3. üîÑ Request/Response Interceptors (Axios-style)
**Feedback**: Some users prefer Axios-style interceptor API
**Reason for Deferral**: Conflicts with unified middleware model (see DECISION_LOG.md D-03)
**Future**: Won't implement - middleware model is sufficient

#### 4. üîÑ Middleware Lifecycle Hooks (onBefore, onAfter, onError)
**Feedback**: Separate hooks for different lifecycle phases
**Reason for Deferral**: Current middleware model handles this via priority
**Future**: Revisit if use cases emerge that can't be solved with priorities

#### 5. üîÑ Built-in Cache Middleware
**Feedback**: Request-level caching would be useful
**Reason for Deferral**: Too opinionated for core, many caching strategies exist
**Future**: Document caching patterns, consider as external middleware package

### Rejected API Suggestions (2)

#### 1. ‚ùå Add jQuery-style Promise Extensions (`.done()`, `.fail()`)
**Feedback**: Some users want jQuery-style promise methods
**Reason**: Anti-pattern, doesn't align with modern JS standards
**Alternative**: Use standard `.then()`, `.catch()`, `async/await`

#### 2. ‚ùå Support Callback-Style APIs
**Feedback**: One tester requested callback-style API for legacy compatibility
**Reason**: v2 is modern, Promise-based only (see V2_PLAN.md)
**Alternative**: Use Promise-to-callback adapters if needed

---

## Documentation Improvements (16 Implemented)

## Migration Feedback (5 Fixed, 1 Deferred)

### Migration Success Rate: 100% (3/3 Projects)

Three testers successfully migrated real projects from v1 to v2:
- **Project A**: REST API client (250 LOC) - Migration time: 2 hours
- **Project B**: Full-stack app (500 LOC) - Migration time: 4 hours
- **Project C**: GraphQL client (150 LOC) - Migration time: 1.5 hours

Average migration time: **2.5 hours per project**

### Migration Issues Fixed

#### 1. ‚úÖ Confusing Error: "use() requires a function"
**Issue**: Error message unclear when passing wrong argument type
**Fix**: Improved error messages with helpful suggestions
**Example**: Now says "use() expects a function, got object. Did you mean to pass a config?"

#### 2. ‚úÖ Breaking Change in `.get()` Not Documented
**Issue**: `.get()` now returns full Response, not just data
**Fix**: Explicitly documented in MIGRATION_GUIDE_V2.md with example
**Added**: Migration warning in alpha changelog

#### 3. ‚úÖ Middleware Execution Order Different from v1
**Issue**: v1 had implicit FIFO, v2 has explicit priorities
**Fix**: Added migration guide section explaining priority system
**Added**: Default priority behavior matches v1 FIFO for unnamed middleware

#### 4. ‚úÖ Type Errors After Migration (TypeScript)
**Issue**: v1 types were loose, v2 strict mode causes errors in user code
**Fix**: Added "TypeScript Migration" section with common type fixes
**Location**: MIGRATION_GUIDE_V2.md section 9

#### 5. ‚úÖ `addMiddleware()` Renamed but Not Everywhere
**Issue**: Old examples still used `addMiddleware()`
**Fix**: Comprehensive search and replace across all docs
**Verification**: Automated link checker added to CI

### Deferred Migration Issue

#### 1. üîÑ Codemod Tool Not Available
**Issue**: Manual migration is tedious for large codebases
**Status**: Codemod development in progress
**Timeline**: Ready for beta release (Phase 4.2)
**Priority**: HIGH - Will significantly improve migration experience
