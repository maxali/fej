# Testing Strategies

Examples demonstrating how to test applications that use fej.

## Examples

### 1. Mocking Requests
How to mock fej requests in your tests.

### 2. Testing with Middleware
Testing applications that use middleware.

### 3. Integration Testing
End-to-end testing with real HTTP requests.

## Running the Examples

```bash
# Install dependencies first
npm install

# Run the tests
node mocking-requests.test.js
node testing-middleware.test.js
node integration-testing.test.js
```

## What You'll Learn

- Mocking HTTP requests for unit tests
