## Issues Identified

### Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Launch)

#### Issue #1: Bundle Size Discrepancy üî¥
**Problem**: Alpha summary claimed 7.67 KB, but actual unminified bundle is 36KB+
**Root Cause**: Build configuration has `minify: false`, size was likely mismeasured
**Impact**: HIGH - Marketing claims may be inaccurate
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS INVESTIGATION**

**Action Items:**
1. Investigate where 7.67KB claim came from
2. Measure actual minified + gzipped size
3. Update bundle size target to realistic value
4. Update all documentation with accurate size
5. Consider enabling minification for production builds

**Recommendation**: Update tsup.config.ts to include minified build, measure accurately, and update all references.

---

### High Priority Issues

#### Issue #2: Codemod Tool Incomplete üü°
**Problem**: Manual migration tedious, codemod promised but not ready
**Status**: In development (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Target**: Mid-beta (Week 7)
**Mitigation**: Well-documented manual migration guide available

#### Issue #3: Test Deprecation Warnings üü°
**Problem**: Tests show v1 deprecation warnings (expected but noisy)
**Status**: Low priority - warnings are intentional
**Mitigation**: Update tests to use v2 API or suppress warnings in test environment

---

### Low Priority Issues

#### Issue #4: Some JSDoc Links Need Updating
**Status**: Minor documentation polish
**Target**: During beta based on feedback

#### Issue #5: Need More Framework-Specific Examples
**Status**: Nice to have
**Target**: Post-beta or community contributions
