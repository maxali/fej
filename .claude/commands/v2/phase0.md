# Phase 0: Preparation (3-4 weeks, 65-90 hours)

## Objectives
1. Establish v1 performance baseline
2. Release v1.9 with deprecation warnings
3. User feedback collection
4. Find co-maintainer

## Tasks

### 0.1 Bug Documentation (8-12h)
**Status**: $ARGUMENTS contains "0.1" → Execute bug documentation
**Deliverable**: Bug inventory with priorities

Tasks:
- [ ] List all known bugs with reproduction cases
- [ ] Prioritize: P0 (crashes/security), P1 (broken core), P2, P3
- [ ] Estimate fix time for each
- [ ] Identify which bugs fixed in v2 vs deferred

### 0.2 v1.9 Deprecation Release (12-18h)
**Status**: $ARGUMENTS contains "0.2" → Execute v1.9 release
**Deliverable**: v1.9 published to npm

Tasks:
- [ ] Add console.warn() for deprecated patterns
- [ ] Create initial migration guide outline
- [ ] Announce v2 timeline (blog, GitHub, README)
- [ ] Set up GitHub Discussion for v2 migration
- [ ] Survey 5-10 users for feedback

### 0.3 Migration Tooling (20-25h)
**Status**: $ARGUMENTS contains "0.3" → Execute migration tooling
**Deliverable**: Codemod prototype

Tasks:
- [ ] Begin codemod development with jscodeshift
- [ ] Create migration testing repository
- [ ] Set up migration validation suite

## Usage

- `/v2:phase0` - Show all Phase 0 tasks and status
- `/v2:phase0 0.1` - Work on bug documentation
- `/v2:phase0 0.2` - Work on v1.9 release
- `/v2:phase0 0.3` - Work on migration tooling

## Success Criteria (Gate 1)
- [ ] Realistic v2 targets set based on v1 data
- [ ] v1.9 released with deprecation warnings
- [ ] At least 50% of active users aware of v2 timeline
- [ ] Migration guide draft reviewed by 3-5 community members

**Ready to start Phase 0?** Let me know which task to begin with, or say "start 0.1" to begin baseline measurement.
