## Technical Status

### Test Results

- **Passing**: 319 (100%)
- **Duration**: 4.31s
- **Coverage**: 100% of public APIs

**Status**: ‚úÖ All tests passing

### Known Issues

#### Critical Issue: Bundle Size Verification üî¥
**Problem**: Alpha claimed 7.67KB, actual unminified bundle is 36KB+

**Root Cause**:
- Build config has `minify: false`
- Size was likely mismeasured or referred to minified+gzipped
- Marketing materials may have inaccurate claims

**Impact**:
- HIGH - Credibility issue if claims are wrong
- Must be addressed before finalizing marketing

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Measure actual minified + gzipped size
2. Update tsup.config.ts to include minified build option
3. Update all documentation with accurate measurements
4. Create clear build size documentation

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs immediate attention
